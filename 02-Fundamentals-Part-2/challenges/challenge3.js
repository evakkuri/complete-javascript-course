/*
Let's go back to Mark and John comparing their BMIs! This time, let's use 
objects to implement the calculations! 

Remember: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height).
(mass in kg and height in meter)

1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass,
  and height (Mark Miller and John Smith)
2. Create a 'calcBMI' method on each object to calculate the BMI (the same
  method on both objects). Store the BMI value to a property, and also return
  it from the method.
3. Log to the console who has the higher BMI, together with the full name and
  the respective BMI. Example: "John Smith's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark 
  Miller's (23.9)!"

TEST DATA: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 
1.95 m tall.

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
